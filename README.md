# MyResumeApp

This app title Mayowa's Resume is an app that displays my name, track, abit of myself, social media links and what I do for a company if employed.
The optimal layout is  portrait however I made attempt to make it adaptive to other screens
It was built solely using kotlin language in the activities and the designs were done manually from the xml layouts
I attempted to develop the UI from this source https://www.behance.net/gallery/153595503/Interactive-Resume?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Csimple+resume+template
with a little adjustment to suit my level of know-how
The libraries used were default dependencies on android studio such as the constraint dependency
I would have loved to have properly improved the screen adaptability, and implemented the night mode feature and implicit intent especially on my social media links
I had challenges with the UI development as I am a beginner and finding youtube resources that was mostly done in kotlin as most seen were written in java
